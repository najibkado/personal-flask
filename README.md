Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I made a simple website with an introductory page as the index page,
designed with bootstrap and css.

The second page is the about page which consist of a simple page about myself
also designed with css and bootstrap

The third page is the services page which consist of a table of services that's being offered by me
the page was also designed with css and bootstrap

The fourth page is the contact page which consist of a simple card with contact details.
it was designed with bootstrap and css also.


However, i used sass for making the stylesheet and all pages are linked and can be navigated through from each page of the website
I have used a lot of pictures in making the website, furthermore the website is responsive.

All requirements have been met according to the instructions.
